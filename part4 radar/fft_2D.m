% 2-D Transform
% The 2-D Fourier transform is useful for processing 2-D signals and other 2-D data such as images.
% Create and plot 2-D data with repeated blocks.

% Take a 2D signal matrix
P = peaks(20);
X = repmat(P,[5 10]);
imagesc(X)

%% 
% TODO : Compute the 2-D Fourier transform of the data.  
% Shift the zero-frequency component to the center of the output, and 
% plot the resulting 100-by-200 matrix, which is the same size as X



% In the case of Radar signal processing. Convert the signal in MxN matrix, where M is the size of Range FFT samples and N is the size of Doppler FFT samples:
signal  = reshape(signal, [M, N]);

% Run the 2D FFT across both the dimensions.
signal_fft = fft2(signal, M, N);

% Shift zero-frequency terms to the center of the array
signal_fft = fftshift(signal_fft);

% Take the absolute value
signal_fft = abs(signal_fft);

% Here since it is a 2D output, it can be plotted as an image. Hence, we use the imagesc function
imagesc(signal_fft);
